# Technologies Used


- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- PosgreSQL


# Development & Problem Solving Process

-I spent a good amount of time researching different ideas and landed on a workout application that utilized CRUD because its something I have used many times before. 

-It allowed me to navigate the back end construction with more confidence because it made sense to hae a user want to create a workout with their reps, sets and time spent, then update or delete with an id after they were able to view their log.


# Unsolved Problems

- I had more difficulty with tying the front end to the back because of syntax erros that took less time to fix then to find.
